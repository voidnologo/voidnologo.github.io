We've been talking about making public our private
ranting and ravings about the state of delusion that so many people
seem to live in.  Baseless, factless, purely emotionally based
critique of the world around them.  It is enough to drive one batty.
We will destroy them with logic, some reasoning skills, and the pure
fires of wrath burning within our bellies, or something like that...
For what it is worth, we may not be all-knowing, but we are all-
opinionated, and do have some education and information to back our
rantings.  We do not encourage this to be taken with a "grain of salt"
(har, har), but if you do not agree, and actually have basis for your
disagreement, we encourage educated discussion. Tally ho!
