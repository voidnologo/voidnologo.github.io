When I started learning more about politics, I read
"The Law" by Frederic Bastiat. That book is easy to read and
understand. It helped me to understand that



_Law is force._



This principle alone is important to understand. Why? Because it
explains why law should not compel (or force) people to contribute to
any number of social causes and issues. The law should only force the
ability for everyone to enjoy life, liberty, and property.



Currently, the law compels us to participate in a myriad of
unconstitutional programs that manipulate the free market, demotivate
people to work hard, and tax us to do such.



What does the law force you to do?
-M.
