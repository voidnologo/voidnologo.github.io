I saw an article today
about a prisoner who had died recently in Guantanamo prison, name
undisclosed. It caused me to pause and reflect on the abomination that
is this prison. At this prison people are held without charge for
indeterminate amounts of time and can face torture while they are
there. By providing them a convenient label such as "enemy combatant"
and using euphemisms such as "waterboarding" and "interrogating" while
torturing them, an attempt is made to justify these actions. Trials,
when they do occur, are allowed outside of the regular court system as
a result of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This new justice
system for so-called terrorists is not justice but rather an
abomination. But one of the most revolting parts of it all is the
attitude of "kill them all" and "let them rot" displayed by some of
our citizenry toward terrorists (presumed terrorists, that is, because
they have not even been charged with terrorism). Justice is getting
thrown out with the bathwater.  -T.
