While watching the Olympics opening ceremony, I've been struck by a
sense of sadness and emotion.  There is so much acrimony, bitterness,
and denigration of each other.  Political pundits that preach the need
for unity and solidarity (as long as you are backing their causes) try
to outdo each other in their ability to mock and scorn the other
nations.  I was overwhelmed by a sense of how we are _all_ children of
our Father in Heaven.  Should this not be a special opportunity to
celebrate the joy of the diverse expressions of being brothers and
sisters?  How is it that we cannot find it with in ourselves to love
and cherish each other?  Why is it that even those who should hold
fast to the truth so often are found mocking and scorning the
principles that would create the world that they so avidly preach for?
How have we as a world become so lost and deceived?
