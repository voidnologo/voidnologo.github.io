Voting is the last step. The candidates have been
decided, primaries done, and campaign mailers and radio ads have been
going for awhile. Then you vote. It's over. Someone wins and they fill
the office for the allotted time.

Actions between elections amount to writing to, calling and leaving
messages, and possibly even talking personally with the person in
office. You have an opinion? Let it be known. Beg, plead, educate.

Exercising your right to vote is important. I really believe that. But
most of the real decisions are decided before that in campaigns,
caucuses (kind of like voting, I admit), and party conventions.
