Peace and security in the last days will be come about among a people
who serve the Lord. [3 Nephi 22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22?lang=eng)
is the Savior quoting Isaiah (one of two parts of Isaiah quoted by the Savior recorded in 3 Ne; the other
is in [3 Ne 16:18-20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16.18-20?lang=eng)).
This chapter is a description of the "heritage of the servants of the Lord‚Äù
([v.17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16.17?lang=eng)), including the following
blessings:



  * "My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed"
  * "Great shall be the peace of thy children"
  * "Thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near thee"
  * "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper"
  * "Every tongue that shall revile against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn"



These blessings will be received by the "servants of the Lord", of
whom the Lord states, "their righteousness is of me" ([v.17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22.17?lang=eng)).
These blessings are not exclusive to any particular group or people but are
open to any who will serve the Lord. The previous chapter mentions
four groups from among whom will be servants of the Lord. First, the
Gentiles that repent and hearken to His words ([v.22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21.22?lang=eng)).
Next, the Remnant of Jacob that will live among the Gentiles (Nephites and
Lamanite decendents or others?) ([v.23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21.23?lang=eng)).
Third, the decendents of the Nephites and Lamanites
([v.26](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22.26?lang=eng)).
Finally, the lost tribes of Israel ([v.26](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22.26?lang=eng)).
Those four groups effectively cover everyone on the earth.
This says to me that the Lord is no respecter of persons and His
blessings including eventual peace and security are reserved for
anyone who will be His servant, any who will accept Him as their
leader and sovereign.
