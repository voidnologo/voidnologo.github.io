I believe the Constitution to be the guideline in deciding what should be the law of the land.

Some people question the wisdom of using the Constitution as a
guideline. They argue it is outdated and inappropriate for current
situations.

So, why should the Constitution reign supreme?

1. It is the current contract between the people and the government.
2. It was developed by inspired people.
3. It is the document that gives us the most freedom and liberty.
4. It does not infringe on God-given rights.


What other reasons are there for citing the Constitution as the
ultimate authority?
-M.
