"Have you seen it?" "Have you read the book?"
"Did you like the shaky camera?"

"Yeah, twice." "Yeah, I finished it in 2 days!" "No, it was too
distracting."

_The Hunger Games_ movie, based on the book by Suzanne Collins, was
big this summer. I read this book about 2 years ago. While it is YA
fic that has its share of teen romance, I found the book series
intriguing with the portrayal of a government in a post-apocalyptic
America.

Moving past the "it was good" and "it stuck close to the book"
analysis of the movie, here's a list of similarities between the
situation in our nation now and the situation of the nation in the
book.

1. Strong central government.
2. Manipulation through media.
3. Watching and glorification of violence.
4. Seemingly all-powerful president.
5. Pop culture as a distraction from real issues.


What similarities did you notice?
