The Declaration of Independence describes life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as rights that are endowed by
Our Creator. They are God-given rights.

This means that no other entity has given us these rights. God gave us
those rights when he sent us to earth. Government, organizations, or
other entities did not allow us these rights out of the kindness of
their collective hearts.

This is important to remember because if you start to believe that you
are generously _allowed_ these rights by another, you give them the
power to take those rights away from you. A complaint might sound
like, "Come on, be nice." Weak.

I retain my God-given rights because I am a person. Strong.

Our Founding Fathers understood this principle. It is what propelled
them to act strongly in defense of those rights.
