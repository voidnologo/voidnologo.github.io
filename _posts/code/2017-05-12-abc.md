## What is an Abstact Base Class (ABC)?

[Python ABC](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#module-abc)

An __ABC__ is a class that provides no implementation or an incomplete implementation and which cannot be implemented directly.
In some languages these are called protocols or interfaces.  Abstract classes will have one or more subclasses which
will implement the abstract features, called _concrete_ classes.

This is useful when you may have a group of classes that you wish to enforce having certain methods implemented, or when
it doesn't make sense for a class to have an instance but for a specific subclass to do so.

### Syntax

We can mark something as being an ABC by:

{% highlight python %}
from abc import ABC, ABCMeta

# Option 1:
class Base(ABC):
    pass

# Option 2
class Base2(meta=ABCMeta):
    pass

{% endhighlight %}
Note: The type `ABC` is still `ABCMeta`.  It is just a helper class for easier syntax.

In order to declare a method in an ABC as being abstract, use the `@abstractmethod` decorator.

{% highlight python %}
from abc import ABC

class Base(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def must_implement_later(self):
        pass

{% endhighlight %}

Putting it all together:


{% highlight python %}
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Base(ABC):

    def real_method(self):
        print('real')

    @abstractmethod
    def abstract_method(self):
        pass

class Child(Base):

    def abstract_method(self):
        print('In abstract:', self.__class__.__name__)


>>> b = Base()
'Cant instantiate abstract class Base with abstract methods abstract_method'
>>> c = Child()
>>> c.real_method()
'real'
>>> c.abstract_method()
'In abstract: Child'

{% endhighlight %}


## Example

Let's make a pet store.  In it there will be a bunch of Animals.  Having an instance of `Animal` doesn't make sense, so we
will need to make some `Cat`s, `Dog`s, `Bird`s, etc.  I suppose we could implement the whole taxonimic ranking of domain,
phylum, family, etc. down to species as ABCs, and only allow a specific species to be instantiated.


{% highlight python %}
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        print(f'A {self.__class__.__name__} says {self.sound}')

    @abstractmethod
    def move(self):
        pass

    @property
    def family(self):
        print(self.family)

class Cat(Animal):

    sound = 'Meow'
    family = 'Felidea'

    def make_sound(self):
        super().make_sound()

    def move(self):
        print('quadraped, lithe')

class Dog(Animal):

    sound = 'Bark'
    family = 'Canidae'

    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size

    def make_sound(self):
        if self.size == 'large':
            self.sound = 'Woof'
        elif self.size == 'tiny':
            self.sound = 'Yip'
        super().make_sound()

    def move(self):
        print('quadraped')

class Bird(Animal):

    sound = 'Tweet'
    family = 'Aves (class)'

    def move(self):
        print('fly')
