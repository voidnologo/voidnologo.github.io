## Test Driven Development (TDD)

[Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) posited that the three laws of TDD are:

> 1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
> 1. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
> 1. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

I have found my code to be more succinct, cleaner, and much better functioning as I have tried practicing
TDD over the last couple of years.
