Periodically I get sent videos of some kid or adult doing some amazing performance with some sort
of title generally using phrases like "mind-blowing", "superstar", "amazing", "jaw-dropping" and the like.
And a lot of times they are.  But when the post gets to the "martial arts" part of the title, I start to
cringe.  They are great _performances_, but not martial arts.

Look at these two videos.  One is an outstanding _martial arts_ demonstration.  The other is a great _stunt_
performance.

The last couple of years I've had the opportunity to sit on the judging panel of a couple open martial arts tournaments.
There are so many different forms and styles out there that you often don't have a any knowledge of the form they are demonstrating,
so you have no idea if they are doing it right or not.  Some styles have lots of jumps, some kicks, some punching, others use
weapons; it would seem impossible to judge one against another.  Consequently you learn to look at the fundamentals:
control, focus, power, balance, commitment.

Last year our kendo club participated in a tribute show honoring a great martial artist.  One of the other groups decided to do
some flashy spectacle complete with "demo boards", wafer thin sheets of perforated wood with some explosive compound in the seams
so the boards would literally explode when impacted.  It may have looked cool, but was very disappointing, especially since many of
those participating in that demo are fairly competent martial artists.  I don't understand why you would ditch the art and go with
fluff, especially at an event intended to pay homage.  Actually, I think I do understand: most martial arts tend to be pretty dull
to watch if you aren't already into it.

Of particular dread to me are the baton twirling with katana videos.  The comments section of these videos are rife with statements
about how the performer would "decimate anything that came against them".  In most, if you put an edge on the blade they are playing
with, by about half way through the solo show there would be body parts strewn all over while the spectators put up umbrellas to
protect from the arterial spurting. Inevitably after one of these goes viral, some one will show up "wanting to learn kendo their whole
life" and then disappear when they find out that is not at all what we do.

Or a bravado will show up at the dojo expecting to school us with their prowess they developed in their backyard while constantly
streaming youtube videos.  Unfortunately one such individual huffed off in a cloud of profanity when he found out that
"butterfly floats down the mountain stream" followed by a quick "boar rushing from the grove" is easily countered
by "wait until you get close" followed by "sword smashes you in the ribs".
