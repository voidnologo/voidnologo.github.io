              During our time together on our Platform team, Caleb quickly emerged as a very strong technical leader in the realm of Software Development. His work on our Platform (specifically in Python and Elixir) paid off in dividends as he worked tirelessly to help us be able to deal with many different technical challenges. I appreciate that he never hesitated to roll up his sleeves and dig in to help other engineers resolve problems. Also his dedication to sharing and teaching technical knowledge, and his willingness to lead tech discussions has been a huge help to our team. I would absolutely work with Caleb again given the chance.
