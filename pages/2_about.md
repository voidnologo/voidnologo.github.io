## whoami

I am a mostly self taught programmer who is passionate about Python and mentoring.

I spent 6 1/2 years programming in a proprietary mainframe scripting language
using the best programming practices of the 1980's.  Finding myself being leached
of a love of code, I changed my career to join a webdev software company, picked up
Python, and have been loving it.


## Mentoring

In high school I spent a lot of time in the computer lab.  Entering college I was
eager and excited to learn more programming, only to be confronted by professors who
loathed students and obviously despised the curriculum.  It was soul crushing being
constantly surrounded by a constant barrage of negativity.  I ended up leaving the CS
department and evnentually got a degree in another field (Political Science) that I found
interesting and enjoyable.  I still had an interst in programming and continued spiking
around on personal projects the whole time.

I often wonder what my life would have looked like if I had had a mentor or someone to
coach me through the tough times.  I had opportunities, but either didn't recognize them
or take advantage.  Would I have another decade of experience in my current field?  I certainly
don't regret the experiences that I've gained by taking a different path, but there are
certainly costs associated with it.

I hope that I can spark that love of programming in others who are interested.  I love
to see the excitement of someone's first program that they wrote all by themselves.
Perhaps I can help someone through the tough times where nothing seems to execute right,
the language is becoming more complex, or burn out is setting in.

## Things I Do

## Talks and Presentations

I have greatly enjoyed sharing the things I am learning.

### Teaching Youth to Code

Talk I gave at Pyowa about my experiences teach youth to code.
I wander around a lot, and the camera went very red.  Sorry.

### So You Want (Someone Else) to Learn to Code

Given at [Iowa Code Camp](http://iowacodecamp.com/session/list#3), fall of 2017.

 My first programming classes in college were so bad that I withdrew
 from school and worked for a couple of years before regaining a love for programming.
 Since then I've had a number of opportunities to mentor youth wanting to learn
 programming, teach a class for homeschoolers, give presentations at high schools,
 and mentor new hires fairly fresh to professional programming. Two years ago I made a
 radical shift in my professional career and once again had the opportunity to be reminded
 of what is is like to go back to the beginning and learn afresh.

 Discussion items:
 - Inspiring love of programming
 - Experiences of what has worked and not
 - Tools, learning materials, teaching
 - Mentoring others

### Batteries Included: The Python Standard Library

Series of talks I am working on to present at Pyowa.  I'll post slides/code as I give them.
