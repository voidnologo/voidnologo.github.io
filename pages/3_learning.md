# Learning Resources
<hr/>

## Beginner

#### Swift

- If you have a Mac, Swift Playgrounds is fantastic.  Starts off as easy game style, but quickly becomes powerful programming.

#### JavaScript

- Khan Acadamy has a great intro course using JavaScript.  Nice thing is that it all runs in your web browser so you donâ€™t have to do any special set up on your computer.

#### Python

- Al Sweigart has some fun books to get started with programming.  You can read all of his books online for free.
  Cracking Codes with Python or Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python are probably the best ones for never having coded before.

- DjangoGirls has an easy to follow tutorial on making a website with the Django framework.  This is what I do at work.

- If you like a school course style of learning, this site is really good:

## Intermediate


#### Python

- When you are ready to really start diving in, _Test-Driven Development with Python_ is one of my favorite books.
  Really dive into Django, TDD, and web development.

- Aaron Maxwell's Powerful Python Blog and newsletter contains a lot of great advice and tips.

- _Fluent Python_, by Luciano Ramalho is fantastic.  An updated 2nd edition of this book is coming out December 2021.

- While the code sources are in python, _Math for Programmers_ is a solid overview of a lot of math topics and shouldn't really be thought of as a "python" book.

#### VIM

- Want to learn the greatest editor, but feel overwhelmed by all the memes of how hard it is?
  Have a ton of fun learning!
