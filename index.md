# About

Enthusiastic backend systems engineer who has been building web applications for almost a decade.
I am passionate about mentoring all the way from interns through senior engineers.
I enjoy leading and being part of software teams where we collaborate to build top-notch, reliable and maintainable APIs that drive the business forward.

Everyday I want to learn something new and feel challenged to improve.
