# About

An enthusiastic backend systems engineer who has been building web applications for almost a decade.
I am passionate about mentoring all the way from interns through senior engineers.
I enjoy leading and being part of software teams where we collaborate to build top-notch, reliable and maintainable APIS that drive the business forward.

Everyday I want to learn something new and feel challenged to improve.

    Just once in a while you encounter one of those engineers whose is a true technical master.
    And just once in a while, you encounter one of those engineers who is such an exceptional human individual, that they make a whole team work better together.
    But to find both of those qualities in ONE PERSON? That's rare.

    Caleb is that guy.

<blockquote>
    During our time together on our Platform team, Caleb quickly emerged as a very strong technical leader in the realm of Software Development.
    His work on our Platform (specifically in Python and Elixir) paid off in dividends as he worked tirelessly to help us be able to deal
    with many different technical challenges. I appreciate that he never hesitated to roll up his sleeves and dig in to help other engineers
    resolve problems. Also his dedication to sharing and teaching technical knowledge, and his willingness to lead tech discussions has
    been a huge help to our team. I would absolutely work with Caleb again given the chance.
